Title: Clan vs Clan - A Deadly Serious Game!

Description:

Based on the missionaries and cannibals game. Two clans are on one side of a
void and must cross safely to the other side.  There is only one vehicle and
it can carry only two beings.  One clan is VERY hungry and if at anytime they
out number the other clan on either side of the void, they'll eat them.  The
goal of the game is to make sure that both clans cross the the other side of
the void in an uneaten state.
